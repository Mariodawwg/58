        <p>little restaurant tucked inside a by-lane of Juhu. Blink and you will miss the entrance to the cafe. So
          be alert enough to spot the black signboard that says "Prithvi cafe" while you are on the main road. The
          restaurant has a reasonably good menu at reasonable prices. The food is delicious, the servings are quite
          large and some dishes can be shared by 2 people. Attracts quite a trendy crowd of aspiring celebrities on show
          days. Be sure to book in advance to avoid disappointments. On other days, the crowd there is pretty hep &
          happening. Hosts the famous "Prithvi theater fest" , which you must attend if possible

          Greece has the longest coastline in Europe and is the southernmost country in Europe. The mainland has
          rugged mountains, forests, and lakes, but the country is well known for the thousands of islands dotting
          the blue Aegean Sea to the east, the Mediterranean Sea to the south, and the Ionian Sea to the west.

        <p>Where to begin, where to begin! You know a movie is outstanding when the end credits alone are more epic than
          the majority of films released in the last 20 years! This film is the pure definition of an emotional roller
          coaster and throughout its run time brings about fascination, humor, sadness, incredible excitement, and sheer
          finality. This is not your typical superhero movie and some viewers used to the entertaining, nonstop action
          style of the previous films may be disappointed, but I think that this movie brilliantly satisfies and
          subverts expectations.</p>

        <p>This is a fantastic movie, and I am not lying! my 13 year old sister loves this movie, and I can't fault this
          either. It was one of the first movies I ever saw, so that accounts for how much I love it. The animation is
          superb, the backgrounds look so rich, and for once, there are no stiff movements. The highlights were the
          stampede and the fight between Scar and Simba. The music by Hans Zimmer is outstanding, a perfect mix of
          African chants and pure Hollywood. The songs are absolutely great, I had no idea that Elton John could write
          like that. The best song is "Can you feel the Love Tonight?" but the others go without fault, "Circle of Life"
          is so spirit rousing especially. Likewise with the voice overs. Jonathan Taylor Thomas is very likable as
          Young Simba, and Matthew Broderick, while not as good, is above average too. James Earl Jones lends his
          booming voice to the majestic King Mufassa, and Nathan Lane, Rowan Atkinson and Whoopi Goldberg provide
          flawless comic relief. The vocal standout is Jeremy Irons as Scar, who frightened me when I was little. Scar
          is up there with the best Disney villains, like Jafar, Malificent and Frollo. The humour here is fantastic,
          and you cry here a bit here as well. I highly recommend the stage version in the West End, and the sequels are
          actually two of the better DTV sequels.10/10..</p>

        <p>Across the Spider-Verse is a movie that has taken the world by storm, and for good reason. The movie is a
          must-watch for anyone who enjoys a good story, stunning visuals, and thrilling action sequences. This movie is
          a sequel to the 2018 movie, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse, which was already a massive hit. The sequel
          takes the story to the next level, and it is a movie that you simply cannot afford to miss.

          One of the most spectacular aspects of the movie is its animation. The movie is beautifully crafted, with
          every frame looking like a work of art. The animation is so good that it makes you feel like you are watching
          a comic book come to life. The use of different animation styles for different characters adds to the overall
          visual appeal of the movie. The attention to detail is incredible, and it is clear that the filmmakers put a
          lot of thought and effort into creating a visually stunning movie.

          Another reason why Across the Spider-Verse is a must-watch is its storyline. The movie takes place in an
          alternate universe, where different versions of Spider-Man exist. The central character, Miles Morales, is a
          new Spider-Man who is just learning to use his powers. He is joined by other versions of Spider-Man, each with
          their own unique abilities and stories. The movie explores themes of family, friendship, and the
          responsibility that comes with having great power. The storyline is engaging and keeps you hooked from start
          to finish.

          Finally, the action sequences in the movie are simply breathtaking. The fight scenes are choreographed to
          perfection, with each character using their unique abilities to their fullest potential. The use of
          slow-motion and other cinematic techniques adds to the overall impact of the action sequences. The final
          battle is particularly impressive, with the fate of the multiverse hanging in the balance.

          In conclusion, Across the Spider-Verse is a must-watch movie that is sure to leave you breathless. The
          stunning animation, engaging storyline, and thrilling action sequences make it a movie that you simply cannot
          afford to miss. If you are a fan of Spider-Man or just love a good superhero movie, then this is the movie for
          you. So, grab some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the ride. You won't be disappointed.</p>
